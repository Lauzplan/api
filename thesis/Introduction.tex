\section{Context}
% Context: Sketch the context and domain of the work. 
\section{Problem}
% Problem:  Describe  and  define  the  problem  that  will  be 
% tackled in this thesis. 
\section{Motivation}
% Motivation: Motivate why this problem is a relevant one. 
% Why  is  this  problem  important,  complex,  not  yet  solved, 
% what are the shortcomings today. Optionally add a motiva-
% tion why you have chosen this particular thesis topic or why 
% this topic was proposed. 
\section{Objectives}
% Objectives: Highlight the intended objectives of your the-
% sis. What is the goal of this work? (In the conclusion chap-
% ter  you  will  come  back  to  these  objectives  and discuss  to 
% what extent you managed to achieve those objectives.) 
\section{Approach}
% Approach: Without going in full detail, present in general 
% terms how you will solve the problem and achieve the ob-
% jectives. 

\section{Contribution}
% Contributions:  Explicitly  highlight  the  major  and  minor 
% research contributions of your work. These can be of vari-
% ous kinds but it is important to stress the novel aspect; e.g.:  
%   identification  or  specification  of  a  new  relevant 
% problem; 
%   proposal  of  a  novel  solution  to  an  existing  prob-
% lem; 
%   new  mathematical  formalisms,  definitions,  theo-
% rems or proofs; 
%   design  of  a  novel  framework,  system,  language, 
% …; 
%   a  comparison  (or  survey)  of  existing  theories, 
% models, designs, systems or implementations in a 
% novel way;  
%   first implementation of a designed system significantly improved implementation of an existing 
% system); 
%   an  empirical  analysis,  for  example  a  study  of  the 
% performance of an implemented system; 
%   confirming  or  validation  of  the  correctness  of 
% someone  else’s  work  (for  the  first  time  or  in  a 
% novel way). 

\section{Roadmap}

% Roadmap:  Finish  this  section  by  announcing  how  the  re-
% mainder of your thesis document is structured, e.g.: 
% “The  remainder  of  this  document  is  structured  as 
% follows: the next two chapters provide the necessary 
% background  material  and  report  on  related  work. 
% Then, the proposed solution to the problem is intro-
% duced,  motivated,  defined  and  worked  out.  The 
% software architecture supporting the implementation 
% of that solution is then explained, and exemplified. 
% An  experiment/validation/case  study  is  then  con-
% ducted  in  order  to  validate  the  solution.  Finally,  a 
% conclusion  delivers  the  main  contributions  of  this 
% research  and  we  present  some  avenues  of  future 
% work.” 
% Hint: Try to phrase that roadmap paragraph in concrete terms 
% dedicated to your concrete problem and solution. If someone 
% else can just copy paste it and put it in his graduation thesis, 
% then you are probably not concrete enough.
